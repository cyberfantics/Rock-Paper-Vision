## How It Works
1. **Hand Tracking**:
   - Uses `cvzone.HandTrackingModule` for detecting and interpreting hand gestures.
2. **Gameplay**:
   - Recognizes the player's gesture.
   - Generates a random AI move.
   - Compares gestures to determine the winner based on traditional rules:
     - Rock beats Scissors.
     - Scissors beats Paper.
     - Paper beats Rock.
3. **Scoring**:
   - Updates and displays the score for both player and AI in real time.
   - Visual feedback enhances the game experience.
